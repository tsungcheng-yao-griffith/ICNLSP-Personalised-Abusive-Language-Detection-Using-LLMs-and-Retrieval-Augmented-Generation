**Note 1:** The 7th International Conference on Natural Language and Speech Processing has accepted this [work](https://github.com/tsungcheng-yao-griffith/ICNLSP-Personalised-Abusive-Language-Detection-Using-LLMs-and-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation/blob/main/Personalised%20Abusive%20Language%20Detection%20Using%20LLMs%20and%20Retrieval-Augmented%20Generation.pdf). **Note 2:** Our experiments use a simulator as a preliminary study to assess the feasibility of the proposed solution. The input is replaced with test data, and the RAG component is simplified by embedding hand-selected rules into prompts.
