Additional Knowledge Base:
Here are the association rules mined from user attributes and their impact on identifying harmful messages:
Rule 1:
Antecedents: Flag_Low_Rationality, Flag_Ex_High_SD
Consequents: discomfort
Support: 0.0014
Confidence: 0.78
Lift: 2.31
Explanation: When users exhibit low rationality and extremely high standard deviation in identity, there is a strong association with message content leading to discomfort (discomfort), with a lift of 2.31.

Rule 2:
Antecedents: Flag_Very_High_Irrationality, Flag_Low_Rationality
Consequents: discomfort
Support: 0.0025
Confidence: 0.72
Lift: 2.13
Explanation: The combination of very high irrationality and low rationality significantly correlates with messages causing discomfort (discomfort), with a lift of 2.13.

Rule 3:
Antecedents: Flag_Very_High_Irrationality, Flag_Low_Rationality, Flag_Ex_High_SD
Consequents: discomfort
Support: 0.0014
Confidence: 0.78
Lift: 2.31
Explanation: When users display very high irrationality, low rationality, and extremely high standard deviation in identity, there is a strong association with message content leading to discomfort (discomfort), with a lift of 2.31.

Rule 4:
Antecedents: Flag_Low_Rationality, Flag_Ex_High_SD
Consequents: discomfort
Support: 0.0014
Confidence: 0.78
Lift: 19.00
Explanation: Low rationality and extremely high standard deviation in identity are strongly associated with very high irrationality and messages causing discomfort (discomfort), with a lift of 19.00.

Rule 5:
Antecedents: Flag_Very_High_Irrationality, Flag_Very_High_SD, Flag_Low_Rationality
Consequents: discomfort
Support: 0.0012
Confidence: 0.66
Lift: 1.95
Explanation: The combination of very high irrationality, very high standard deviation in identity, and low rationality moderately correlates with messages causing discomfort (discomfort), with a lift of 1.95.
